1. Initialize variables count_length, count_words, count_vowels to 0.
2. Read the input sentence as a string.
3. For each character in the sentence, do the following:
   a. Increment the count_length variable by 1.
   b. If the character is a vowel (i.e., 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), increment the count_vowels variable by 1.
   c. If the character is a space, increment the count_words variable by 1.
4. Increment the count_words variable by 1 to account for the last word in the sentence.
5. Print the count_length, count_words, and count_vowels variables.

Here is the JavaScript code for the above algorithm:

let sentence = prompt("Enter a sentence: ");

let count_length = 0;
let count_words = 0;
let count_vowels = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < sentence.length; i++) {
    count_length++;
    if (/[aeiou]/i.test(sentence[i])) {
        count_vowels++;
    }
    if (sentence[i] === ' ') {
        count_words++;
    }
}

<!-- count_words++; // to account for the last word in the sentence -->

console.log("Length of sentence:", count_length);
console.log("Number of words:", count_words);
console.log("Number of vowels:", count_vowels);
